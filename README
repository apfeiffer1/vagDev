# VagDev

A simple project to ease the setting up of development VMs for the
CMS conditions (and possible other environments) using vagrant. 

To get the initial "bare box", use the following command:

	vagrant box add --insecure slc6-jul13  https:/cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/slc6-base-jul13.box

Then, to use this for your testing set ups, do:

   	git clone https://github.com/apfeiffer1/vagDev.git 
   	cd vagDev/slc6
   	vagrant up
   	vagrant ssh

should be all you need to set up a devbox and use it. 

Enjoy ! :)
